# Assignment Description: Functions and Header Files in C

This assignment helps us understand how "functions" and "header files" work in C programming. 
Functions make programs easier by dividing them into smaller parts that perform specific tasks, making the code simple and reusable.
We wrote programs to check Armstrong numbers, "Adams numbers, and Prime Palindrome numbers", which helped us learn how to create and use functions properly.
We also created custom "header files" like mylib.h and arraylib.h to store function declarations and improve code organization. This made our program more modular and easier to maintain.

Overall, this assignment improved our knowledge of modular programming, function reusability, and code organization in C

# Compile and run
gcc main.c arraylib.c -o arraytest
./arraytest


# Sample Output
[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
Max at index 2
[5, 1, 4, 1, 3]
Min at index 1
Average = 2.80
Sorted array: [1, 1, 3, 4, 5]
Value 4 found at index 3
